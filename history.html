			<h2> Characters and Caricatures, 1700 - 1770</h2>
			<img class="image" src="images/1700.jpg" alt="Image">
			<p> The cartoon art form began with 'caricatura'. A caricature - from the Italian caricare, to load or exaggerate - is a drawing
				that gives weight to the most striking features of its subject for comic effect. The great Italian masters such as Leonardo
				da Vinci, Annibale Carracci and Gian Lorenzo Benini, all drew caricatures. These were technical exercises in virtuosity
				with the aim of defining the essence of a person in a few deft strokes of the pen. </p>
			<p>
				Many English artists looked to Italy for inspiration, but one man did not. William Hogarth, painter and engraver, believed:
				"Everything requisite to compleat the consummate painter or sculptor may [be had] with the utmost ease without going
				out of London". Hogarth created a new form of picture-story, 'comic history-painting' full of 'characters', not 'caricatura',
				copies of nature, not exaggerations. His 'modern moral subjects', that can be seen in The Harlot's Progress and The Rake's
				Progress, depict critical moments in life, in act and consequence. Time is represented in space, between and within each
				scene. It is for this reason that Hogarth is widely regarded as the father of British caricature, in spite of himself,
				and of the comic strip. </p>
			<h2> 'The Golden Age', 1770 - 1830</h2>
			<img class="image" src="images/GoldenAge.jpg" alt="Image">
			<p> From the 1770s it was the gentleman amateur and semi-amateur, such as Townshend, Bunbury, Woodward and Nixon, who transformed
				the artform, introducing a more playful style and a strong element of personal caricature. Social satire blossomed, offering
				humorous observations on current fashions and social pretensions. In the 1780s political satire ripened. Print-shops
				flourished in the City, Westminster and St. James's, many holding caricature exhibitions. The hand-coloured copper-plate
				etching, freer in style that the engraving, became fashionable: often priced at 2 shillings (10p) or more it was a luxury
				item, and beyond the means of most. </p>
			<h2>Modern Times 1914 - 1961</h2>
			<img class="image" src="images/ModernTimes.jpg" alt="Image">
			<p> In the First World War, cartoonists rallied to the patriotic cause portraying an encounter between the national symbols
				and personifications. The morale-boosting works of Bert Thomas and Bruce Bairnsfather proved popular with British troops
				at the front. The first half of the twentieth century saw the heydey of the popular magazine, and cartoons helped to
				determine its graphic style and character. William Heath Robinson joined The Sketch in 1906 and entertained its readers
				through two world wars. H.M. Bateman perfected the wordless strip cartoon, and his 'The Man Who...' series of colour
				cartoons filled the centre-spread of The Tatler in the 1920s and 1930s. </p>
			<p>Victor Weisz, 'Vicky', one of Britain's best post-war political cartoonists, was forced to flee Nazi Germany in 1935.
				When he started at the News Chronicle in 1939 his editor advised a crash course in British culture: he soon had a witty
				command of a British cartoonist's stock references and motifs, including Shakespeare and Tenniel's Alice drawings. Ronald
				Searle has been described as 'arguably the foremost graphic artist of [the twentieth] century', and is unquestionably
				one of the most influential. The malevolent schoolgirls of Searle's 'St Trinian's' appealed to a new public taste for
				black, cynical humour cultivated in wartime. In his later work a baroque extravagance of detail is painstakingly built
				up with his extraordinary line - stuttering, fidgety, barbed.

					<h2>The New Satire 1961 -</h2>
					<img class="image" src="images/New.jpg" alt="Image">
					<p>Britain was finally coming out of a post-war period dominated by deference and social conformity. A younger generation
						of comedians was appearing on stage, radio and television. In 1961 a new satirical magazine Private Eye was founded.
						It was a magazine of political gossip and disclosure that ripped aside the curtains of gentility and decorum that Punch
						had upheld for over a century. For cartoonists it was a breath of fresh air, publishing cartoons that no other newspaper
						would print. For the first time in many decades caricature took centre stage. Two revolutionary artists pushed British
						satire to the extreme, both visually and politically: Ralph Steadman and Gerald Scarfe. Wally Fawkes, 'Trog', brought
						intense focus to caricature and political cartooning through his ability to condense a complex situation into a single
						memorable image. Peter Fluck and Roger Law had worked together since the 1960s. In the 1970s they began producing three-dimensional
						caricatures for the [Sunday] Times and other publications. Out of this work grew the satirical show Spitting Image,
						first screened in Britain in 1983, featuring Fluck and Law's latex puppets. </p>
